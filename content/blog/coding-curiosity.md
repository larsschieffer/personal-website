# My Journey in Coding

I started coding more than a decade ago. It began with personal projects, then
expanded into larger challenges at university, and later into enterprise
projects as part of my work. Along the way, I’ve realized there’s always
something new to learn, an algorithm to handle data more efficiently, a better
way to structure a feature, or ways to improve how users experience an
application. **And I love it**.

## The Pull of New Tools

Every programming language or framework has its quirks and challenges. So when a
new framework pops up, it’s tempting to dive in and explore. That’s especially
true if you’re someone like me who enjoys trying new things and tweaking
workflows.

The fear of missing out on something exciting is real, though. Over the years,
I’ve explored many frameworks and tools.

- React looks interesting, let’s build a quick to-do app.
- Svelte has an interactive tutorial? Let’s try it out.
- At work, I wrote applications with Angular and Spring Boot, so should I check
  out Next.js, Remix, or Vue?

While I enjoyed learning all these tools, I often ended up with small side
projects. I wasn’t stuck in tutorial hell, but I wasn’t building much of lasting
value either.

### Should You Chase Every New Framework?

No, but you shouldn't stop exploring new tools and frameworks. Learning is
important, but it needs focus. The grass is not always greener on the other
side.

## Sharpening Skills vs. Chasing Trends

In my opinion, it’s easy to fall into the trap of trying out everything at once.
Like a child in a candy store. But I’ve found that going deeper into a few tools
or concepts is more rewarding than trying to cover everything at once.

I like to think of coding skills as tools in a toolbox. You don’t need to master
every framework, find the one you are most effective. It’s better to understand
a few tools deeply, and knowing the differences to the other ones, than to spread
yourself too thin.

## Balancing Curiosity and Productivity

One lesson I’ve learned is how to balance curiosity with productivity. For
example, when working on side projects, I try to avoid time-consuming tasks like
constant dependency updates or time-consuming server setups. At the same time, I
make sure I’m not neglecting things like security or maintainability. This can
easily achieved, by using the right tools.

That’s one reason I switched my personal website from Remix to Hugo. It
simplified my workflow and reduced maintenance overhead. While I gave up
server-side rendering, the site loads much faster now, and since I’ve been
working more with Go, it felt like a natural fit. This change gave me more time
to focus on other projects instead of worrying about unnecessary tidy-up work.

## In Summary

Over the years, I’ve realized that I get more out of focusing on deeper, more
meaningful learning. Instead of chasing every new framework or library, I’ve
found value in spending my time on tools and concepts I want to use long-term.
For me, it’s not about trying everything. It’s about improving my strong
foundation and professional experience as a software engineer to build user
friendly and efficient applications.
