In my thesis, I explore the concept of the Numeric Density Function, first
introduced by W. Klein√∂der. This representation uses numeric values to model
probability density functions, offering an efficient way to perform operations
like the convolution of distributions. Essentially, the function condenses a
probability density into a finite number of values, each calculated using
integrals of equal width. By adjusting the width, one can control the precision
of the stored values. These functions play a crucial role in tools like PEPP.

PEPP (Performance Evaluation of Parallel Programs), developed by Franz Hartleb
and his team, estimates the execution time of parallel programs using a
stochastic graph model. In this model, each task is represented as a node, and
random variables, associated with probability density functions (and their NDF
representation), are used to simulate execution times.

For my thesis, a working implementation of the NDF approach was developed,
featuring a user interface created in Java. This tool can generate NDFs for
exponential and Erlang distributions while maintaining accuracy within a certain
error margin. Along with binary operators like convolution, minimum, and
maximum, the tool can simulate phase-type distributions via the Cox
representation. The thesis outlines the mathematical principles behind NDFs,
details the implementation, and describes the user interface and its features.
